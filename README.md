_Reference_: https://java-8-tips.readthedocs.io/en/stable/parallelization.html  
For more info about spliterators please refer my other github project:
* https://github.com/mtumilowicz/java11-spliterator

Note that this project is the exact copy of my other github project:
https://github.com/mtumilowicz/fork-join-find-minimum
but using spliterator + parallel streams instead of fork-join API.

# project description
Find minimum in the stream of ints in a parallel way with full
control over splitting.
